## Description

[Nest](https://github.com/nestjs/nest) framework TypeScript starter repository.

## Project Structure

The project follows a modular structure based on NestJS best practices:

- `src/`: Contains the main application code
  - `modules/`: Each module represents a feature of the application
    - `appointment/`: Handles appointment-related functionality
    - `slot/`: Manages slot-related operations
    - `config/`: Manages day-off and working hours related operations
  - `scriptss/`: Contains scripts for database data initiation
  - `dtos/`: Contains DTOs (Data Transfer Objects)
  - `config/`: Configuration files and environment variables
  - `database/`: Database-related files
  - `main.ts`: Entry point of the application


## Project setup


$ yarn install


## Database Configuration

Before running the project, make sure to set up your database credentials in the `.env.dev` file. Add the following environment variables:


```
DB_HOST=your_database_host
DB_PORT=your_database_port
DB_USERNAME=your_database_username
DB_PASSWORD=your_database_password
DB_NAME=your_database_name
  ```


Replace the placeholders with your actual database credentials.

## Compile and run the project

```bash
# development
$ yarn run start

# watch mode
$ yarn run start:dev

# production mode
$ yarn run start:prod
```

## Database Choice: PostgreSQL

For this appointment system, I've chosen PostgreSQL as the database management system. Here's why:

1. **Robust and Reliable**: PostgreSQL is known for its reliability, data integrity, and correctness, making it an excellent choice for systems that require accurate scheduling and data management.

2. **ACID Compliance**: PostgreSQL fully supports ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) properties, ensuring that the appointment data remains consistent and accurate even under high concurrency.

3. **Advanced Features**: PostgreSQL offers advanced features like JSON support, which allows for flexible storage of configuration data, and powerful indexing capabilities for optimized query performance.

4. **Scalability**: As the appointment system grows, PostgreSQL can handle increasing amounts of data and concurrent users efficiently.

5. **Strong Community and Support**: With a large and active community, PostgreSQL benefits from regular updates, extensive documentation, and a wide range of tools and extensions.

6. **TypeORM Compatibility**: PostgreSQL works seamlessly with TypeORM, my chosen ORM, allowing for easy database operations and migrations.

7. **Time and Date Handling**: PostgreSQL has excellent support for date and time operations, which is crucial for an appointment scheduling system.

By leveraging PostgreSQL's features, I ensure that the appointment system is built on a solid, performant, and scalable foundation.
